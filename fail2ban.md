# Fail2Ban

Fail2Ban is an intrusion prevention software that protects computer servers from brute-force attacks. It monitors some log files and will ban IP addresses that shows brute-force-like behavior.

In particular, Fail2Ban monitors SSH connection attempts. After 5 failed login attempts on SSH, Fail2Ban will ban the corresponding IP address from connecting through SSH for 10 minutes. If this IP is found to recidive several times, it might get ban for a week.

## Unban an IP address

To unban an IP address from Fail2Ban, you first need to access your server by some mean (e.g. from another IP address by the one being banned).

Then look at Fail2Banâ€™s log to identify in which jail the IP address was put: 

```bash
$ tail /var/log/fail2ban.log
2019-01-07 16:24:47 fail2ban.filter  [1837]: INFO    [sshd] Found 11.22.33.44
2019-01-07 16:24:49 fail2ban.filter  [1837]: INFO    [sshd] Found 11.22.33.44
2019-01-07 16:24:51 fail2ban.filter  [1837]: INFO    [sshd] Found 11.22.33.44
2019-01-07 16:24:54 fail2ban.filter  [1837]: INFO    [sshd] Found 11.22.33.44
2019-01-07 16:24:57 fail2ban.filter  [1837]: INFO    [sshd] Found 11.22.33.44
2019-01-07 16:24:57 fail2ban.actions [1837]: NOTICE  [sshd] Ban 11.22.33.44
2019-01-07 16:24:57 fail2ban.filter  [1837]: NOTICE  [recidive] Ban 11.22.33.44
```

Here, the IP address `11.22.33.44` was banned in the `sshd` and `recidive` jails.

Then unban the IP address with the following commands: 

```bash
$ fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip 11.22.33.44
$ fail2ban-client set recidive unbanip 11.22.33.44
```
