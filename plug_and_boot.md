# Plug and boot your server up

* Plug your server in wired Ethernet **directly to your router**. Do not use a wireless connection or  an intermediate router if you want the network configuration to be automatic.

* Do not forget to **plug a screen** if you want to see how boot is going, and a keyboard if you want to have a **command-line access** to your server.

* Power up the server and wait until you see a big squared `Y` :

*Write down the `IP address` field visible on the screen: It is your server's **local IP address**.*
