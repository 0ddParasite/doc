This is the documentation for YunoHost, a libre operating system whose aim is to democratize self-hosting and server administration.

As a soon-to-be administrator of your own server, go to the [Admin guide](/admindoc) to learn more about self-hosting, how to install your YunoHost server and install your first apps.

Your server's administration interface offers an [Apps catalog](/apps). If you are eager to see which apps have been packaged for YunoHost, you can explore it here too!

The [Community](/community) is here for you, if you need some help to [chat](/chat_rooms) with us or reach the [forum](/community/forum), or read more about our project organization.
