Since version 4.3, YunoHost includes a mecanism to interface your server with your DNS registrar API, with the purpos of simplifying and automatizing DNS records registration and maintenance.

The procedure does require an initial configuration where you will need to generate an API key on your registrar's interface.

Not all registrars are supported though. So far, the community tested and validated the interface with [Gandi](https://gandi.net) and [OVH](https://ovh.com), which are recommended. The interface with other registrar may work but is still considered experimental until we gather feedback from the community.

TODO/FIXME : add proper screenshots of config panel procedure, etc.
