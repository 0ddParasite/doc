#Installation guide

You have two ways to install YunoHost:

1. From a USB key or a CD-ROM (below guide)
2. [Through the install script on an existing Debian system](/#/install_on_debian)

### Pre-requisite

* An x86-[compatible machine](/#/compatible_hardware) dedicated for YunoHost. Be careful not to have any unsaved data on it before installation.
* Another computer to read this guide and to access your server.
* A [reasonable ISP](/#/isp), with good upstream bandwidth, unlimited download/upload, and tolerant of self-hosting.
* A USB key (via [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.net/more-infos-and-get-it/)) or a CD burned with the latest YunoHost ISO: http://build.yunohost.org

### Boot on CD-ROM drive or USB key

Boot up your server with the USB key or a CD-ROM inserted, and select it as bootable device by pressing one of the following keys (hardware specific): ```<ESC>```, ```<F8>```, ```<F10>```, ```<F11>```, ```<F12>``` ou ```<SUPPR>```
