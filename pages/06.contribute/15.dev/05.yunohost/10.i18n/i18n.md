## Add or change a text

Normally you should only modified [the locales/en.json file](https://github.com/YunoHost/yunohost/blob/dev/locales/en.json), this file will be imported into [translate.yunohost.org](https://translate.yunohost.org) and used as a referenced by translators.

If you add a key:

 * try to keep the alphabetical order ;).
 * use "{arg}" format string argument
 * in some place you can use newlines, tags like \<code\>, \<cmd\> or even html tags, but don't forget to test your string into CLI **AND** Webadmin to see if it renders correctly.

Bellow an extract othe the `en.json` locales file:
```json
{
    "aborting": "Aborting.",
    "action_invalid": "Invalid action '{action}'",
    "additional_urls_already_added": "Additionnal URL '{url}' already added in the additional URL for permission '{permission}'",
    "additional_urls_already_removed": "Additionnal URL '{url}' already removed in the additional URL for permission '{permission}'",
    "admin_password": "Administration password",
```


## The `m18n` object

Moulinette allow to import an object called `m18n` dedicated to manage locales.

```python
from moulinette import Moulinette, m18n
```

### m18n.n and m18n.g
TODO


## Object, functions and format in which internationalization is already included

In order to get a code a bit more concise and avoid to much call to `m18n.n`, some part of the code directly include this mechanism to reduse the verbosity.
