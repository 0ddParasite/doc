#Installation guide

You have two ways to install YunoHost:

1. From a USB key or a CD-ROM (below guide)
2. [Through the install script on an existing Debian system](/install_on_debian)

### Pre-requisite

* An x86-[compatible hardware](/compatible_hardware) dedicated to YunoHost. Be careful to avoid having any unsaved data on it before installation.
* Another computer to read this guide and to access your server.
* A [reasonable ISP](/isp), with good upstream bandwidth, unlimited download/upload, and tolerant of self-hosting.
* A USB key (via [Unetbootin](http://unetbootin.net/more-infos-and-get-it/)) or a CD burned with the latest YunoHost ISO: http://build.yunohost.org

### Boot on CD-ROM drive or USB key

Boot up your server with the USB key or a CD-ROM inserted, and select it as bootable device by pressing one of the following keys (hardware specific): ```<ESC>```, ```<F8>```, ```<F10>```, ```<F11>```, ```<F12>``` ou ```<SUPPR>```


### Installation process
Connect the server to your Ethernet router.

Select "Graphical Install" and follow the instructions. You get to choose the system language and keyboard layout, then you must confirm the full formating of the hard drive.

The installation process will run on itself, automatically downloading the required packages.

If this step is not successful, you probably have a connection problem. Check that your Internet connection is working.
