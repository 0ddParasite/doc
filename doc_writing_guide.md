# Guide to writing application documentation

## Pages for user / administative documentation

Add a one-click installation button (like for example: https://yunohost.org/#/app_piwigo)

Classification of the application can be done using the available tags (genre, Git, management association, e-mails, etc.)

*/Find a suitable documentation license. Permissive or not? (CC BY_SA)/*

## Clarify the types of uses it has (special and general application (editorial choice)

 + For links to other languages, add (en)` for Egnlish, and so on.

### Things to include in application documentation

 1. An index of what is included, without reiterating the full content of what is to be found in subsequent chapters.
 1. A one-click install button.
 1. A general presentation of the application and its function.
 1. A section detailing administration of the application.
 1. A further section on changes specific to YunoHost.
 1. A section about the desktop client (if applicable). Links to different third party applications (if they exist), (or a link to a list of applications [framalibre.org](https://framalibre.org)) or a link to a page that has to do with the different official applications (if applicable).
 + A further section:
    - Links to the official website.
    - Links to the package in YunoHost.
 1. Documentation of any further uses (documentation of an application).

## Roadmap

1. Documentation of the applications.
   1. Document how the application operates in use (marked: work) level 8/7/6.
   1. Translate the documentation at-least into French and English.
   1. Send a PR to the repository of the app that details its documentation.

## Document an application

Do you need to detail how it works?
