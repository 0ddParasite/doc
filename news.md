#Website, Twitter, demo and more !

<span class="badge">Posted 2014-15-03 18:30</span>

As you probably noticed, we have made **huge changes** on our website and documentation platform recently. We are using a homemade solution called [Simone](https://github.com/Kloadut/Simone), which focus on the page **content readability**. The documentation pages are [hosted on Github](https://github.com/YunoHost/doc), you can thus make **pull requests** or edit pages directly on this website (try the `ESC` key ;-))

However, we are releasing today the new [frontpage](/) as well as many new documentation pages. You should be able to navigate between them easily.

We are trying hard to provide a consistent and **comprehensive documentation** as soon as possible. This is a real **time-consuming** job and after all we are a bunch en frenchies trying to write in English :3


### Twitter
A brand new **Twitter account** is available ( [@yunohost](http://twitter.com/yunohost) ), we will try to keep it up-to-date with frequent little news.


### Demo
A working [demo platform](/try) is available ! Keep in mind that it runs a beta release and does not support concurrent actions in the web administration... It may seem a bit buggy :)


Do not hesitate to leave a feedback on our chatroom accessible from the [frontpage](/) or on your favorite XMPP client at [support@conference.yunohost.org](xmpp:support@conference.yunohost.org?join)

#YunoHost v2 beta4

<span class="badge">Posted 2014-14-03 20:47</span>

Big announcement today: we are releasing **YunoHost v2 beta4** -- probably **the last beta** before the RC version. A lot of things have been improved within and around the software. 

As usual, here is a non-comprehensive list of improvments:

* Many features added to the **administrator interface**, in particular ACL on apps, monitoring view, service management view, along with few bugfixes.
* A minimal **user panel** has been implemented in SSO protected apps. It will be enhanced really soon.
* The **mail configurations** have been simplified. We now keep **Amavis/SpamAssassin** on every instance.
* New apps were added: **Zerobin**, **PHPMyAdmin** and **Jirafeau** (and [more to come](/apps) !).
* **SSOwat** path-finding has been slightly improved.

And brace yourselves, there is more incoming:

* **Persistent rules** in SSOwat
* A big rework of the **moulinette** (already in a good way)
* YunoHost **design identity** has been discussed and will soon be integrated
* Global server **upgrade functions**
* **I18n** of the web administration and CLI

For more informations, you can view a non-updated roadmap [here](/roadmap)

And as always, a big virtual hug to all the contributors who have made this release possible. It is so wonderful to work with such a motivated and efficient team:
